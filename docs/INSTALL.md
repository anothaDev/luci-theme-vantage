# Installing Vantage

This guide covers installing the Vantage theme (`luci-theme-vantage`) and
dashboard (`luci-app-vantage`) on a router running OpenWrt, building them
into your own firmware, and undoing all of it again.

All examples use `192.0.2.1` for the router. That is a placeholder from the
documentation address range; replace it with your router's LAN address.

## Quick install

**From the signed repository** (recommended). On the router, over SSH,
once:

```sh
wget -O /etc/apk/keys/vantage-signing.pem https://anothadev.github.io/luci-theme-vantage/vantage-signing.pem
sha256sum /etc/apk/keys/vantage-signing.pem   # must be c8a6c83eeb49ca2407932fb5e95785776128cef87db75ebaea0fe4171eee2157
echo 'https://anothadev.github.io/luci-theme-vantage/25.12/packages.adb' >> /etc/apk/repositories.d/customfeeds.list
apk update && apk add luci-theme-vantage luci-app-vantage
```

If the fingerprint differs, stop and delete the key file. Later versions
install with `apk update && apk upgrade`. See
[Signed repository](#signed-repository).

**From files**, on OpenWrt 25.12, with the two `.apk` files and `SHA256SUMS` from a
[release](#from-a-github-release) (or your [own build](#build-from-source))
in the current directory on your computer:

```sh
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS
scp -O luci-theme-vantage-*.apk luci-app-vantage-*.apk root@192.0.2.1:/tmp/
ssh root@192.0.2.1 'apk add --no-network --allow-untrusted /tmp/luci-theme-vantage-*.apk /tmp/luci-app-vantage-*.apk'
ssh root@192.0.2.1 'rm -f /tmp/luci-theme-vantage-*.apk /tmp/luci-app-vantage-*.apk'
```

Then **log out of LuCI and log in again**. The dashboard is now the first
page you see after login. Every step is explained below.

## Requirements

### OpenWrt

| OpenWrt | Package manager | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 25.12.x | apk (`.apk`) | Supported. Built with the 25.12 SDK and tested. |
| 24.10.x, 23.05.x | opkg (`.ipk`) | Untested. `dev/build/sdk-build.sh` can build `.ipk` files for these releases, but the LuCI differences have not been checked and nothing is guaranteed. |
| Snapshots | apk | Untested. |

Check what your router runs:

```sh
ssh root@192.0.2.1 'cat /etc/openwrt_release'
```

`DISTRIB_RELEASE` must start with `25.12`. Both packages are
architecture-independent (`noarch`), so the same two files install on every
target: MIPS, ARM, x86 and the rest.

### Packages on the router

Nothing to install beforehand on a standard OpenWrt image with LuCI. The
required packages are dependencies, so apk would fetch any that are missing
from your configured package feeds.

| Package | Needed by | Why | On standard LuCI images |
|---|---|---|---|
| `luci-base` | theme, app | LuCI itself | yes |
| `rpcd` | app | LuCI's backend for ubus calls | yes |
| `rpcd-mod-iwinfo` | app | lists radios and connected stations | yes (with `luci-mod-status`) |
| `rpcd-mod-rrdns` | app, optional | client names from reverse DNS | yes (with `luci-light`) |
| `umdns` | app, optional | client names from mDNS (`.local` announcements) | no |

When an optional package is missing, the dashboard leaves that name source
out and keeps working.

Space: the download is about 105 KB in total, and the two packages take
about 400 KB once installed (less on a compressed overlay).

### Browser

The theme and dashboard use current CSS (`:has()`, `color-mix()`, container
queries, subgrid). Any evergreen browser from 2023 or later works: Chrome
or Edge 117+, Firefox 121+, Safari 16.2+ (these minimum versions come from
the features the CSS uses; older browsers are not tested). No external
fonts, scripts or CDNs are loaded, so the UI works without internet access.

## Get the packages

You need three files: `luci-theme-vantage-<version>.apk`,
`luci-app-vantage-<version>.apk` and `SHA256SUMS`. Install either package
on its own or both together; the theme doesn't need the app, and the app
works under any LuCI theme. For a translation, add its language packages
(see [Languages](#languages)).

### From a GitHub release

Releases are published at
<https://github.com/anothaDev/luci-theme-vantage/releases>.

> **Note:** if the release you want has no packages attached,
> [build from source](#build-from-source).

Each release carries the two `.apk` files, the language packages of every
translation it has (`luci-i18n-vantage-*.apk`, see [Languages](#languages))
and a `SHA256SUMS` file listing their SHA-256 hashes. Download the packages
you want and `SHA256SUMS` from the release page, then check them on your
computer:

```sh
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS            # Linux
grep luci-theme-vantage SHA256SUMS | shasum -a 256 -c    # macOS, per file
```

Every file must report `OK`. (`--ignore-missing` skips listed files you did
not download; with macOS's `shasum`, check each file as shown.) On Windows, `Get-FileHash <file>` in
PowerShell prints the hash to compare by hand.

`SHA256SUMS` comes from the same place as the packages, so this check
catches damaged or incomplete downloads, not a tampered release. For an
independent check, rebuild the release yourself and compare hashes
([below](#verify-a-release-by-rebuilding-it)).

### Signed repository

Every release is also published as an apk repository at
`https://anothadev.github.io/luci-theme-vantage/25.12/`, with its index
(`packages.adb`) signed by the project key. apk checks the signature
against the keys in `/etc/apk/keys/` and each package against the hash in
the index, so `--allow-untrusted` is not needed.

The project's public key is `keys/vantage-signing.pem` in this repository
and on the repository site. Its SHA-256 (of the PEM file) is:

    c8a6c83eeb49ca2407932fb5e95785776128cef87db75ebaea0fe4171eee2157

Set it up once on the router:

```sh
wget -O /etc/apk/keys/vantage-signing.pem https://anothadev.github.io/luci-theme-vantage/vantage-signing.pem
sha256sum /etc/apk/keys/vantage-signing.pem   # must be c8a6c83eeb49ca2407932fb5e95785776128cef87db75ebaea0fe4171eee2157
echo 'https://anothadev.github.io/luci-theme-vantage/25.12/packages.adb' >> /etc/apk/repositories.d/customfeeds.list
apk update && apk add luci-theme-vantage luci-app-vantage
```

Upgrades then come with the rest of your packages:

```sh
apk update && apk upgrade luci-theme-vantage luci-app-vantage
```

**Switching from a file install:** when a package was installed from a
`.apk` file, apk pins that exact file in `/etc/apk/world`
(`luci-theme-vantage><Q1…`), so `apk upgrade` keeps it. After adding the
key and the repository, run `apk add luci-theme-vantage luci-app-vantage`
once: it replaces the pins with plain names and installs the repository
version. From then on `apk upgrade` works. Check with
`grep vantage /etc/apk/world` (plain names, no `><`).

To stop trusting the project, delete the key and the repository line:
`rm /etc/apk/keys/vantage-signing.pem`, then remove the line from
`/etc/apk/repositories.d/customfeeds.list`. Installed packages stay.

The repository holds the latest release only; to install an older version,
use its files from the release page. The key is used by CI on tagged
releases; if it ever has to be replaced, the new fingerprint will be
announced in a release and in this guide, and you would install the new
key the same way.

### Build from source

`dev/build/sdk-build.sh` builds both packages, and a language package for
each translation in the tree, inside the official OpenWrt SDK container
image.

You need:

- Linux with **podman 4.3 or later** (rootless is fine; the script maps
  your user to the image's build user with
  `--userns=keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000`, so any host UID works), `git`,
  `bash` and **Node.js** (the built packages are verified with
  `security-tests/verify_built_apk.js`). The script calls `podman`
  directly and does not use Docker.
- About **5 GB of disk** for the SDK image
  (`ghcr.io/openwrt/sdk:x86_64-25.12.4`, pulled by digest) plus a few
  hundred MB while building. The container is removed afterwards; the image
  stays.
- **Network access**: the first run pulls the image, and every build clones
  OpenWrt's package feeds (over HTTPS, at the commits pinned in the SDK
  image) inside the container.
- **Time**: pulling the image takes longest. The build itself takes a few
  minutes.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anothaDev/luci-theme-vantage.git
cd luci-theme-vantage
dev/build/sdk-build.sh              # SDK 25.12.4, current commit (HEAD)
dev/build/sdk-build.sh 25.12.4 <tag-or-commit>
```

The first argument is the SDK release, the second any git revision. The
script builds from a fresh clone of that commit, not from your working
tree, so uncommitted changes are not included.

What goes into a build is pinned:

- **SDK image by digest.** The script keeps a table of SDK releases and
  image digests and refuses a release that is not in it. The image already
  contains the extracted SDK; the script checks that it is the SDK tarball
  whose SHA-256 is recorded in the table (and in OpenWrt's signed
  `sha256sums` for that release) and skips the image's `setup.sh`, which
  would download the SDK again.
- **Package feeds by commit.** The SDK image's `feeds.conf.default` names a
  commit for every feed; the build clones those commits over HTTPS. The feed
  pins come from the pinned image.
- **Build entrypoint by hash** (`dev/build/entrypoint.sh`, from
  `openwrt/gh-action-sdk`).

The container runs without capabilities (`--cap-drop=all`,
`no-new-privileges`), sees the commit's clone read-only and can write only
to a fresh output directory. It keeps network access, which the feed clone
needs.

Before anything is written to `dist/<release>/`, the script checks every
package with `security-tests/verify_built_apk.js`, using the SDK's own
`apk`, `jsmin` and `po2lmo`: the file list, modes and owners, metadata and
dependencies, install and remove scripts, and that every packaged file is
the commit's source after LuCI's build transforms (JavaScript minification,
`?v=<version>` in templates, catalogues compiled by `po2lmo`). The set of
packages must be exactly the two plus one language package per
`po/<lang>/` directory of each, named the way the SDK's `luci.mk` names
them. Then it replaces the previous contents of `dist/<release>/` (only its
own file names) with:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `luci-theme-vantage-<version>.apk`, `luci-app-vantage-<version>.apk` | the packages |
| `luci-i18n-vantage-<lang>-<version>.apk`, `luci-i18n-vantage-theme-<lang>-<version>.apk` | language packages, one pair per translation (none without translations) |
| `SHA256SUMS` | their SHA-256 hashes |
| `BUILDINFO` | commit, SDK release, image digest, SDK tarball hash, entrypoint hash, feed commits |
| `packages.adb` | only with signing, see [Signed packages](#signed-packages) |

The script exits 0 only when all packages were built, verified and
hashed. After a successful build it deletes its work directory; after a
failure it keeps it (`vantage-build.XXXXXX` under `$TMPDIR`, or `/tmp`) and
prints its path, with the full `build.log`. Delete it once you no longer
need the log. It also leaves the SDK's `apk`, `jsmin`, `po2lmo` and
`luci.mk` in `dist/.tools/` so the packages can be re-checked later:

```sh
node security-tests/verify_built_apk.js dist/25.12.4
```

**Other SDK releases.** Only 25.12.4 is pinned. For another release, add
its digest and SDK tarball line to the table in `sdk-build.sh` (the comment
above the table shows how to get and cross-check both), or pass them for
one build:

```sh
VANTAGE_SDK_IMAGE=ghcr.io/openwrt/sdk@sha256:<digest> \
VANTAGE_SDK_SUM='<sha256> *openwrt-sdk-<release>-x86-64_<...>.tar.zst' \
dev/build/sdk-build.sh <release>
```

`VANTAGE_SDK_IMAGE` must be a digest reference; a tag is refused.

#### Verify a release by rebuilding it

The same commit, SDK release and pinned SDK image produce byte-identical
packages. To confirm that a release's files were built from the source they
claim, build the release tag with the SDK release it was built with (its
`BUILDINFO` says which), then compare:

```sh
dev/build/sdk-build.sh 25.12.4 <tag>
diff dist/25.12.4/SHA256SUMS /path/to/downloaded/SHA256SUMS && echo identical
diff dist/25.12.4/BUILDINFO /path/to/downloaded/BUILDINFO && echo same inputs
```

`BUILDINFO` differs only when the builds used different inputs, for
example another SDK image digest.

To check downloaded packages against a tag's source without rebuilding
(after one build, so that `dist/.tools/` has the SDK's `apk`):

```sh
node security-tests/verify_built_apk.js --rev <tag> /path/to/downloads
```

#### Signed packages

By default the packages are unsigned, and installing them needs
`--allow-untrusted` plus your own hash check. A maintainer who publishes
packages can instead sign a package index. The `.apk` files themselves stay
unsigned and byte-identical (OpenWrt signs indexes, not single packages),
so rebuilding and comparing still works.

Maintainer, once: create an EC key pair **outside the repository** (the
script refuses a key inside it, and `.gitignore` ignores `*.pem` and
`key-build*`), keep the private key secret, and publish the public key and
its SHA-256 somewhere other than the release page:

```sh
( umask 077 && mkdir -p ~/.config/vantage-signing &&
  openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ~/.config/vantage-signing/vantage.key.pem )
openssl ec -in ~/.config/vantage-signing/vantage.key.pem -pubout -out vantage-signing.pub.pem
sha256sum vantage-signing.pub.pem
```

Build with the key; the script passes it to the SDK on standard input
(never on the command line or in a mount), and `dist/<release>/` then also
holds `packages.adb`, the index signed with that key. `BUILDINFO` records
the public key's SHA-256.

```sh
VANTAGE_SIGN_KEY=~/.config/vantage-signing/vantage.key.pem dev/build/sdk-build.sh 25.12.4 <tag>
```

For 23.05/24.10 (opkg) use a usign key (`usign -G -s key-build -p
key-build.pub`); the index is then `Packages` with `Packages.sig`. That
path is untested.

On the router, once: install the public key after checking its SHA-256
against the published value:

```sh
sha256sum /tmp/vantage-signing.pub.pem
cp /tmp/vantage-signing.pub.pem /etc/apk/keys/vantage-signing.pem
```

Then, with the two packages and `packages.adb` copied to one directory
(for example `/tmp/vantage/`), install without `--allow-untrusted`:

```sh
apk add --no-network --repository /tmp/vantage/packages.adb luci-theme-vantage luci-app-vantage
```

apk checks the index signature against `/etc/apk/keys` and each package
against the hash in the index, and ignores an index it cannot verify.
Remove the key with `rm /etc/apk/keys/vantage-signing.pem` when you no
longer want to trust it. The hash-checked `--allow-untrusted` route below
keeps working for unsigned builds.

## Install on the router

### 1. Copy the files to the router

From your computer:

```sh
scp -O luci-theme-vantage-*.apk luci-app-vantage-*.apk SHA256SUMS root@192.0.2.1:/tmp/
```

`-O` makes scp use the classic SCP protocol. OpenWrt's SSH server
(Dropbear) has no SFTP server, and OpenSSH 9.0 and later use SFTP unless
told otherwise; without `-O` the copy fails with an error such as
`ash: /usr/libexec/sftp-server: not found` followed by
`scp: Connection closed`. On Windows, the built-in
`scp` accepts `-O` too; in WinSCP, choose the SCP protocol.

`/tmp` is RAM, so the files are gone after a reboot, which is fine: they
are only needed during installation.

**Or download on the router** once releases are public (OpenWrt's `wget`
follows GitHub's redirects over HTTPS). Take the tag and file names from
the release page:

```sh
cd /tmp
BASE='https://github.com/anothaDev/luci-theme-vantage/releases/download/<tag>'
for f in SHA256SUMS luci-theme-vantage-<version>.apk luci-app-vantage-<version>.apk; do
	wget -O "$f" "$BASE/$f" || break
done
```

### 2. Check the hashes on the router

```sh
ssh root@192.0.2.1
cd /tmp
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

When you copied only some of the packages listed (one of the two, or no
language packages), check just those (`sha256sum -c` fails for files that
are listed but missing):

```sh
grep -E 'luci-(theme|app)-vantage-' SHA256SUMS | sha256sum -c
```

Continue only when every file says `OK`.

### 3. Install

Both packages:

```sh
apk add --no-network --allow-untrusted /tmp/luci-theme-vantage-*.apk /tmp/luci-app-vantage-*.apk
```

Theme only:

```sh
apk add --no-network --allow-untrusted /tmp/luci-theme-vantage-*.apk
```

Dashboard only (works under Bootstrap or any other theme):

```sh
apk add --no-network --allow-untrusted /tmp/luci-app-vantage-*.apk
```

**Why `--allow-untrusted`?** On OpenWrt 25.12, apk only installs packages
signed by a key in `/etc/apk/keys`, normally the OpenWrt release keys.
Vantage is not part of OpenWrt and its packages are not signed, so apk
refuses them (`UNTRUSTED signature`) unless you pass this flag. It turns off
signature checking for that command, which means:

- The hash check in step 2 is the only thing that tells you the files are
  the ones you meant to install. Do not skip it.
- The flag covers everything that command installs, including anything
  apk would fetch from your package feeds in the same run. `--no-network`
  prevents that: apk installs only the named files and fails instead of
  downloading a missing dependency without a signature check. If it
  reports a missing dependency such as `luci-base`, `rpcd` or
  `rpcd-mod-iwinfo` (unusual on a standard image), install it with a
  normal, signature-checked `apk update && apk add <package>`, then repeat
  the `--no-network` command.
- The globs match every version in `/tmp`. Keep only one version of each
  package there, or name the files exactly.
- A maintainer who publishes a signed index lets you skip
  `--allow-untrusted` altogether; see [Signed packages](#signed-packages).

Check the result:

```sh
apk list --installed | grep vantage
```

### 4. Clean up and log in again

```sh
rm -f /tmp/luci-theme-vantage-*.apk /tmp/luci-app-vantage-*.apk /tmp/SHA256SUMS
```

In the browser, **log out and log in again** (or close the LuCI tab and open
a new one, then log in). Two reasons:

- rpcd gives a LuCI session its permissions at login. A session that
  started before the dashboard was installed doesn't have the dashboard's
  permissions, so the dashboard is missing from its menu.
- LuCI caches the menu for the session in the browser's `sessionStorage`.

## What the install changes

| | `luci-theme-vantage` | `luci-app-vantage` |
|---|---|---|
| Files | `/www/luci-static/vantage/` (CSS, icons, logo), `/www/luci-static/resources/menu-vantage.js`, `/www/luci-static/resources/vantage-theme/`, `/usr/share/ucode/luci/template/themes/vantage/` | `/www/luci-static/resources/view/vantage/`, `/www/luci-static/resources/vantage/`, `/usr/share/luci/menu.d/luci-app-vantage.json`, `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/luci-app-vantage.json`, `/etc/config/vantage` |
| Configuration | Registers the theme as `luci.themes.Vantage`. Makes it the active theme (`luci.main.mediaurlbase=/luci-static/vantage`) **only on a first install**, never on an upgrade or reinstall. | None besides its own `/etc/config/vantage` (client names). |
| Menu | – | Adds **Dashboard** (`admin/dashboard`) as the first menu entry, so it is the page LuCI opens after login. Status → Overview is unchanged. |
| After install | Clears LuCI's caches (`/tmp/luci-indexcache.*`, `/tmp/luci-modulecache/`) and reloads rpcd. | Same. |

Nothing else changes. Neither package adds a service, cron job or init
script, and neither touches network, wireless, firewall, DHCP or password
settings. The dashboard only reads status. Its one write is a name you give
a device, stored in `/etc/config/vantage`.

The dashboard's URL is `http://192.0.2.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/dashboard`.

## Switch themes

In LuCI: **System → System → Language and Style → Design**, pick a theme,
then **Save & Apply**. Vantage is listed as `Vantage`. The light / dark /
auto switch in Vantage's top bar is a per-browser setting and doesn't
change the router's configuration.

From SSH:

```sh
uci set luci.main.mediaurlbase=/luci-static/vantage     # Vantage
uci set luci.main.mediaurlbase=/luci-static/bootstrap   # back to Bootstrap
uci commit luci
```

Reload the page afterwards. No service needs a restart.

## Languages

Vantage's texts go through LuCI's translation system. A translation ships
as up to two small packages per language, one for each Vantage package:

| Package | Translates |
|---|---|
| `luci-i18n-vantage-<lang>` | the dashboard (`luci-app-vantage`) |
| `luci-i18n-vantage-theme-<lang>` | the theme (`luci-theme-vantage`) |

`<lang>` is LuCI's language suffix, the same as in OpenWrt's own
`luci-i18n-base-<lang>`: for example `de`, `fr`, `pt-br`, or `zh-cn` for
Simplified Chinese. Each language package depends on its Vantage package
and has the same version. The [README](../README.md#languages) lists the
translations that exist; a release carries the language packages of all
of them.

From the [signed repository](#signed-repository):

```sh
apk update && apk add luci-i18n-vantage-zh-cn luci-i18n-vantage-theme-zh-cn
```

From release files: the language packages are assets of the release, next
to the two packages and listed in the same `SHA256SUMS`. Check, copy and
install them like the others, for example:

```sh
apk add --no-network --allow-untrusted /tmp/luci-i18n-vantage-zh-cn-*.apk /tmp/luci-i18n-vantage-theme-zh-cn-*.apk
```

For LuCI's own pages in the same language, install OpenWrt's
`luci-i18n-base-<lang>` too (`apk add luci-i18n-base-zh-cn`).

Then choose the language in LuCI: **System → System → Language and Style
→ Language**, then **Save & Apply**. `auto` follows the browser's
language. Installing a language package adds its language to that list.

A language package contains only the compiled catalogue
(`/usr/lib/lua/luci/i18n/vantage.<lang>.lmo` or
`vantage-theme.<lang>.lmo`) and a first-boot script that registers the
language (`luci.languages.<lang>`). Texts that are not translated yet stay
in English. `apk upgrade` upgrades installed language packages with the
rest; with files, install the new language packages together with the new
packages. To remove a translation, `apk del` its packages; when you
uninstall Vantage, name its language packages too.

## Upgrade, downgrade, uninstall

### Upgrade Vantage

With the [signed repository](#signed-repository):

```sh
apk update && apk upgrade luci-theme-vantage luci-app-vantage
```

(If you first installed from files, run
`apk add luci-theme-vantage luci-app-vantage` once instead; see
[Switching from a file install](#signed-repository).)

With files: get the newer ones, check their hashes as above, copy them to `/tmp`, then:

```sh
apk add --no-network --allow-untrusted /tmp/luci-theme-vantage-*.apk /tmp/luci-app-vantage-*.apk
```

apk replaces the installed version. Your theme choice is kept (the
upgrade never selects a theme), and so are your device names: when
`/etc/config/vantage` has been changed, apk keeps your file and saves the
packaged one next to it as `/etc/config/vantage.apk-new`, which you can
delete. Log out and in once after upgrading.

### Downgrade

Install the older files the same way. apk installs the exact file you
name, also when it is older than the installed version, and treats it as
an upgrade: theme choice and names are kept. If apk refuses, remove the
package first (below) and then install the older file; removing the theme
switches LuCI to Bootstrap, and the reinstall selects Vantage again.

### Uninstall

```sh
apk del luci-app-vantage luci-theme-vantage
```

Or name just one of them, and add any installed language packages
(`apk list --installed | grep vantage` shows them, e.g.
`luci-i18n-vantage-zh-cn`). What happens:

- **Theme:** if Vantage is the active theme, LuCI switches to Bootstrap (or,
  when Bootstrap isn't installed, to another installed theme), and the
  `Vantage` entry is removed from the theme list. LuCI also falls back to a
  working theme on its own if its theme ever goes missing, so you can't lock
  yourself out of the web interface this way.
- **Dashboard:** the Dashboard entry disappears and LuCI opens Status →
  Overview after login again. If you named devices, apk leaves your
  modified `/etc/config/vantage` in place; delete it with
  `rm /etc/config/vantage` if you don't want to keep it.

Log out and in afterwards to refresh the menu.

### Keep your device names

Device names live in `/etc/config/vantage` and nowhere else. LuCI's backup
(**System → Backup / Flash Firmware → Generate archive**) includes it. To
copy just that file:

```sh
scp -O root@192.0.2.1:/etc/config/vantage ./vantage.config        # back up
scp -O ./vantage.config root@192.0.2.1:/etc/config/vantage        # restore
```

### Upgrading OpenWrt itself

A firmware upgrade (sysupgrade) keeps your settings but not the packages
you installed with apk. After the upgrade LuCI can't find the Vantage theme
and falls back to Bootstrap on its own. Install the packages again as
above; since your settings, theme choice included, were kept, Vantage
becomes the active theme again and your device names are still there.

Attended Sysupgrade (the LuCI app or `owut`) requests a new image with your
installed packages from OpenWrt's build servers. Vantage is not in
OpenWrt's package feeds, so leave it out of that request (or uninstall it
first) and reinstall it afterwards.

## Build it into your firmware

### OpenWrt build system or SDK: add the feed

The repository is an OpenWrt package feed. In your OpenWrt source tree:

```sh
[ -f feeds.conf ] || cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf
echo 'src-git vantage https://github.com/anothaDev/luci-theme-vantage.git' >> feeds.conf
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install luci-theme-vantage luci-app-vantage
make menuconfig
```

In menuconfig, select **LuCI → Themes → luci-theme-vantage** and **LuCI →
Applications → luci-app-vantage** (`y` builds them into the image, `m` only
as packages). Or add them to your `.config`:

```
CONFIG_PACKAGE_luci-theme-vantage=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_luci-app-vantage=y
```

The packages need the `luci` feed (the default feeds include it).

To pin a release, append `;<tag>` to the URL
(`https://github.com/anothaDev/luci-theme-vantage.git;<tag>`). To build
from a local checkout instead:

```sh
echo 'src-link vantage /path/to/luci-theme-vantage' >> feeds.conf
```

### ImageBuilder

With a 25.12 ImageBuilder, copy the two `.apk` files into its `packages/`
directory and name them in `PACKAGES`:

```sh
cp /path/to/luci-theme-vantage-*.apk /path/to/luci-app-vantage-*.apk packages/
make image PROFILE=<your-profile> PACKAGES="luci luci-theme-vantage luci-app-vantage"
```

The ImageBuilder indexes its `packages/` directory itself. The project has
not tested this route, so check the result before you flash it.

### Theme selection on first boot

In a firmware image, the theme registers and selects itself on the first
boot through `/etc/uci-defaults/30_luci-theme-vantage`. Scripts in
`/etc/uci-defaults/` run in alphabetical order, so a script that runs later
and sets the theme (some firmware projects force Bootstrap this way) wins.
To make sure Vantage is selected, add your own script that sorts last, for
example as `files/etc/uci-defaults/zzzz-vantage-theme` in the build tree
(or in the ImageBuilder's `FILES=` directory):

```sh
#!/bin/sh
uci set luci.main.mediaurlbase=/luci-static/vantage
uci commit luci
exit 0
```

The script runs once and is deleted after it succeeds. On a running router,
the two `uci` lines alone do the same.

## Troubleshooting

### Blank page or a spinner that never stops

1. Reload without the cache: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
   (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> on macOS).
2. Log out and in again, or open LuCI in a new tab.
3. Clear LuCI's caches on the router and reload rpcd:

   ```sh
   rm -f /tmp/luci-indexcache.*
   rm -rf /tmp/luci-modulecache/
   /etc/init.d/rpcd reload
   ```

4. Check your browser version against the [requirements](#browser), and
   look at the browser console (<kbd>F12</kbd>) for errors.
5. Still broken? [Switch back to Bootstrap](#switch-themes) from SSH and
   open an issue with the console output.

### Vantage is not in the Design list

```sh
uci show luci.themes
```

must include `luci.themes.Vantage='/luci-static/vantage'`. If it doesn't,
check that the package is installed (`apk list --installed | grep vantage`)
and that `/usr/share/ucode/luci/template/themes/vantage/header.ut` exists,
then register the theme by hand:

```sh
uci set luci.themes.Vantage=/luci-static/vantage
uci commit luci
```

### The Dashboard is missing, or says permission denied

- Log out and in again. Permissions are fixed when a session starts.
- Check that `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/luci-app-vantage.json` exists, then run
  `/etc/init.d/rpcd reload`.
- `root` may use everything. Other LuCI users (set up in `/etc/config/rpcd`)
  see the Dashboard only when their `read` list includes `luci-app-vantage`
  (or `*`). To let them name devices, add `luci-app-vantage-names` to their
  `write` list. Without that, the dashboard works but offers no rename
  button. Names from reverse DNS need `luci-app-vantage-rdns` in the `read`
  list as well (see [Security notes](#security-notes) before you add it).
- The dashboard's radios and SSIDs come from the app's rpcd plugin
  (`/usr/share/rpcd/ucode/luci.vantage`). If they are missing, check that
  `ubus list luci.vantage` shows the object; `/etc/init.d/rpcd reload`
  loads a newly installed plugin.

### Realtime Graphs are empty

Status → Realtime Graphs is a stock LuCI page. It gets its data from the
`luci-bwc` program in `luci-mod-status`:

```sh
which luci-bwc          # normally /usr/bin/luci-bwc
```

If nothing is printed, your firmware image doesn't include it and the stock
graphs have no data under any theme. The Vantage dashboard doesn't use
`luci-bwc`; its throughput charts compute rates from interface counters
and work either way.

### Clients show no names

An access point that isn't the network's DHCP server knows little about its
clients. The dashboard tries, in order: your own name for the device, reverse
DNS, DHCP host names (on the router that hands out addresses), mDNS, the name
the device sends during WPS, the vendor from the MAC address, and finally
"Private device" for phones and laptops that use a randomised MAC address.
The source of each name is shown next to it. Any host on the network can
send mDNS announcements, so an mDNS name is only used when nothing better is
known and nobody contradicts it.

- Reverse DNS needs `rpcd-mod-rrdns` and a DNS server that knows your
  clients. An OpenWrt router's dnsmasq answers for its DHCP leases.
  Users other than `root` also need the `luci-app-vantage-rdns` group.
- mDNS names need `umdns` (`apk add umdns`); names appear as devices
  announce themselves.
- Or name a device yourself: open it on the dashboard and choose **Name this
  device**. Names are saved in `/etc/config/vantage`.

### "not reported" next to noise, SNR or airtime

The Wi-Fi driver didn't report that value, or reported a placeholder.
Vantage says so instead of showing an invented number. Nothing needs fixing.

### Channel Analysis makes Wi-Fi stutter briefly

Status → Channel Analysis is a stock LuCI page. Its scan takes each radio
off its channel for a moment, so clients may notice a short hiccup while the
page is open. The Vantage dashboard never scans.

### Get back to Bootstrap from SSH

If the web interface is unusable, switch the theme without it:

```sh
uci set luci.main.mediaurlbase=/luci-static/bootstrap
uci commit luci
```

Then reload the page. To remove Vantage entirely, see
[Uninstall](#uninstall).

## Security notes

- **What the dashboard may do.** Its rpcd permissions (ACL) are read-only:
  system, network, radio and station status, host hints, mDNS and
  `/proc/stat`. It cannot run commands. Its only write permission, in a
  separate group (`luci-app-vantage-names`), is the plugin method
  `luci.vantage set_alias`, which checks each name on the device and
  writes nothing but `/etc/config/vantage` (at most 512 names). Details
  in the README's [Security](../README.md#security) section.
- **Wi-Fi keys.** The dashboard reads the wireless configuration through
  its own plugin method (`luci.vantage wireless`), which returns SSIDs,
  channels and the encryption mode but no Wi-Fi passwords, SAE passwords or
  RADIUS secrets. A restricted LuCI user who only has the dashboard cannot
  read the keys. (LuCI's own Status and Wireless pages grant more; check
  what else such a user has.)
- **Reverse DNS is a separate group.** `luci-app-vantage-rdns` grants
  `network.rrdns lookup`, whose caller may name the DNS server and port.
  A user who holds it can make the device send DNS queries to any host it
  can reach. Give it only to users you would trust with that; without it
  the dashboard simply shows no reverse-DNS names.
- **The theme** adds nothing about the device to what logged-out visitors
  see (the login page, error pages), and loads nothing from the internet.
  LuCI itself still puts its `L.env` script on those pages: the LuCI
  build on every page and, on "not found" pages, the tree of installed
  menu entries. That comes from LuCI's core templates, happens with every
  theme, and cannot be changed by a theme.
- **Signed repository.** The [signed repository](#signed-repository) is
  the safest route: apk verifies the index signature and every package
  hash itself. Check the key fingerprint before trusting the key.
- **Unsigned packages.** Installing with `--allow-untrusted` means apk
  doesn't check who made the files. Check the SHA-256 hashes every time,
  keep `--no-network` on that command so nothing else is installed
  unchecked, and rebuild the release if you want independent proof of what
  it contains. With a [signed index](#signed-packages) apk checks the
  signature itself.

## Agent-assisted install

If you use a coding agent that can run shell commands on your computer (and
SSH to the router), you can have it do the installation. The prompt below
sets the rules. Fill in the three lines at the top, and read its plan before
you say yes.

```text
Install the Vantage LuCI theme and dashboard on my OpenWrt router.

Router:   root@192.0.2.1   (SSH; copy files with `scp -O`, the router has no SFTP)
Packages: <folder on my computer, or the release page URL> with
      luci-theme-vantage-*.apk, luci-app-vantage-*.apk and SHA256SUMS
Install:  <both | theme only | dashboard only>

Guide: docs/INSTALL.md in https://github.com/anothaDev/luci-theme-vantage
(sections "Install on the router" and "Uninstall").

Rules. Follow every one; if one gets in the way, stop and ask me.
1. Check first, change nothing: run `cat /etc/openwrt_release` and
   `apk --version` on the router. Stop and tell me if DISTRIB_RELEASE does
   not start with 25.12 or apk is missing.
2. Verify with `sha256sum -c` against SHA256SUMS on my computer, and again
   on the router after copying to /tmp. Stop on any mismatch or missing
   file. Never install a file whose hash you have not checked.
3. Before changing anything, back up LuCI's settings:
   `cp /etc/config/luci /tmp/luci.pre-vantage`, and copy that file to my
   computer with `scp -O`.
4. Show me the exact install commands and wait for my "yes" before any
   `apk add` or `apk del`. Install only with
   `apk add --no-network --allow-untrusted <exact /tmp paths of the Vantage files>`.
   If it reports a missing dependency (such as luci-base, rpcd or
   rpcd-mod-iwinfo), ask me, then install it with a plain `apk update && apk add <package>`
   without --allow-untrusted, and repeat the --no-network command.
5. Never run sysupgrade, firstboot, reboot, mtd or anything that flashes
   firmware. Never change passwords, SSH keys, or the network, wireless,
   firewall or DHCP configuration. Do not run `uci set`/`uci commit`
   except the theme selection in the guide, and only if I ask for it.
6. Delete only files you created in /tmp (the copied .apk files and
   SHA256SUMS), by exact name. No `rm -r`, no deleting anything else.
7. If a command fails, stop and show me its output. Do not improvise
   fixes. To roll back: `apk del luci-app-vantage luci-theme-vantage`
   (LuCI switches back to Bootstrap by itself); restoring
   /tmp/luci.pre-vantage to /etc/config/luci is only needed if my LuCI
   settings changed in some other way, and only after I agree.

When done, report the checklist below and remind me to log out of LuCI
and log in again.
```

The agent's report should include:

- OpenWrt release and target (from `/etc/openwrt_release`)
- The hash check result for every file, on the computer and on the router
- Where the backup of `/etc/config/luci` is, on the router and on your
  computer
- Every command that changed something, with its output (at least the
  `apk add` output)
- `apk list --installed | grep vantage`
- `uci get luci.main.mediaurlbase` and `uci show luci.themes`
- Anything it skipped, any warning, and which temporary files it deleted
